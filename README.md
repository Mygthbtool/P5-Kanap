This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

# Kanap

We assume we have a client called "Kanap", a furniture company which sells its products from their physical shop only. The company would now like to add an online store to its physical shop in order to sell its products on the Internet.

My task is to work on frontend side after static pages have been created using HTML and CSS, I need to code the dynamic elements using vanilla JS(No framework) and the API.

### To run this project:###

### Back end Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
